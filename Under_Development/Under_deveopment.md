### Use binder buttons below to run/interact with Application
RStudio: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/katharynduffy/phenoRemote/master?urlpath=rstudio)

### To access AppEEARS data you must edit the following in RStudio
First you must create or log into your earth data portal:https://earthdata.nasa.gov/
In addition you must allow AppEEARS to connect via an API: https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/help
```
username = 'your.username'
password = 'your.password'
```
This is a bug based on API access via AppEEARS that we are currently trying to
navigate.  Our apologies in the meantime.
